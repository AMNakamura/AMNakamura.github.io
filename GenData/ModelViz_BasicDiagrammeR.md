# Causal Conceptual Models

## Simple Directed Acyclic Graph (DAGs) 

[Confound0](https://github.com/AMNakamura/miscellanea/blob/master/modelViz/Confound0.md) creates simple visual diagrams that can describe a causal relationship, using the **DiagrammeR** package. Describes `DOT` graph specifications and `GraphViz` syntax for some well-known and lesser-known examples of confounding, mediation, moderation, and intermediate variable bias.
