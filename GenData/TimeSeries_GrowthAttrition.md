# Measuring and Visualizing Growth and Attrition 

## Measuring Retention over Time

[Grids and Rates](https://github.com/AMNakamura/miscellanea/blob/master/time_series/Retention1_GridsPlusRates.md) generates a series of retention grids, uses the grids to extract n-month retention rates, and visualizes retention over time between cohort groups.


## Visualizing the Balance between Growth Attrition Over Time  

[Layer Cakes](https://github.com/AMNakamura/miscellanea/blob/master/time_series/Retention1_GridsPlusRates.md) generates a series of specialized stacked area charts, using "Layer Cakes" (courtesy [ThinkInsights.net](https://thinkinsights.net/digital/cohort-analysis-using-layer-cake-graphs-with-r/)) to visualize inflow and total cohort membership over time.

## Visualizing Growth and Attrition Using Networks and Alluvial Diagrams

[Networks and Alluvials](https://github.com/AMNakamura/miscellanea/blob/master/time_series/Retention3_Sankey.md) makes use of network and alluvial layouts to examine the flow of cohort members through different groups over time.
