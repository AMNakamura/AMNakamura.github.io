# Welcome

This is my personal website, where I've have organized repositories of mine containing small, miscellaneous data visualization and proof of concept projects, using generated or publicly available datasets.   

I've worked with a variety of statistical and mathematical programming tools over the years, often having to hit the ground running on new projects. So, I always appreciate it when I can find detailed, soup-to-nuts instructions on processes that make it easy to turn data into quickly-accessible information. By giving examples of code, little hacks, and solutions to data-related challenges I've encountered, my hope is to return the favor in a small way. 

This site mainly contains links to markdown documents, with detailed notes presented with inline code, or publicly available datasets from my own and other GitHub repositories. Most tools are free of cost and open source, 
to help promote values of transparency and collaboration, particularly around tools that can help with data access and fluency.
